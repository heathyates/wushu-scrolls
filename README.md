# wushu-scrolls
This is a collection of technical documentation, notes, and cheatsheets put together by Heath Yates. 

## Introduction 

As such, this repo intends to be a collection of many different technical topics, concepts, and frameworks. The documents are hopefully a way to get 0 to 100 fast on many core fundamental topics. It is not meant to be exhaustive, but simply a place. These docs are
intended to me an audience of one, myself. However, they are open source in hopes they are of value to other readers.

## Why is documentation called Wushu Scrolls? 

This is homage to Chinese traditional culture. 

In brief, Wushu is a traditional Chinese martial art that is thousands of years old. It is umbrella term to encompass a plethora of martial art techniques such as striking, grappling, and other weapon based forms. In other words, the foundations of the Wushu art. 
The author has no competence with actual Wushu arts, but has adopted this term for the repo out of respect for this artform. Building on that, scrolls in China was the traditional mechanism to perserve and transmit core martial art knowledge. These scrolls 
typically contained detailed descriptions of techniques and philosophical undertones teaching concepts related to Wushu. The intent was typically not to teach something aggressive, but a form of discipline aimed at personal growth and harmony.
